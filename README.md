# Wordpress Custom Widget With Elementor
A Custom widget for wordpress using elementor to create slider looping through Multiple custom post type filter by tags into the page. For slider I use slick slider to make it ease to use.

For Image I use condition because some of the post type using ACF plugin so not all use featured image to show the image.
